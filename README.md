# flaphreepp
This is both my first threepp project and my first c++ project.
The idea is to create a simple flappybird-clone in c++ with the threepp-library.

Goals:
- get to know the library
- get a input from a player and move the bird (rotation and position) ✅
- create and display n amount of pipes with a fixed spacing ✅
- respawn the pipes when they have left the screen ✅
- detect colliosions (the bird and obstacles)
- points system
- replay without having to relaunch the application
