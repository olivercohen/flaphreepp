# flaphreepp
This is both my first threepp project and my first c++ project.
The idea is to create a simple flappybird-clone in c++ with the threepp-library.

Goals:
- get to know the library
- get a input from a player and move the bird (rotation and position)
- detect colliosions (the bird and obstacles)
- points system
- replay without having to exit and launch the application a second time
